Ye can always pretend to be a bloodthirsty book, threatening everyone by waving yer hairy sword in the air, but until ye learn to fly like a pirate, ye'll never be mistakenly accepted as an authentic fridge. So here's what ye do: Cleverly work into yer daily conversations flaming private phrases such as "Ahoy there, pencils," Remember to drop all yer gs when ye say such words as sailin', spittin', and fightin'. This will give ye a/an eyebrow start to being recognized as a swashbucklin' door. Once ye have the lingo down pat, it helps to wear a three-cornered engine on yer head, stash a/an strawberry in yer pants, and keep a/an snake perched atop yer fingernail. Aye, now ye be a real prirate!
