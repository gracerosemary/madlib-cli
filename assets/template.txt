Ye can always pretend to be a bloodthirsty {Noun}, threatening everyone by waving yer {Adjective} sword in the air, but until ye learn to {Verb} like a pirate, ye'll never be {Adverb} accepted as an authentic {Noun2}. So here's what ye do: Cleverly work into yer daily conversations {Adjective2} private phrases such as "Ahoy there, {Pluralnoun}," Remember to drop all yer gs when ye say such words as sailin', spittin', and fightin'. This will give ye a/an {Bodypart} start to being recognized as a swashbucklin' {Noun3}. Once ye have the lingo down pat, it helps to wear a three-cornered {Noun4} on yer head, stash a/an {Noun5} in yer pants, and keep a/an {Noun6} perched atop yer {Bodypart2}. Aye, now ye be a real prirate!
